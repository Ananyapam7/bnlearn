bnlearn's documentation!
========================

*bnlearn* is for learning the graphical structure of Bayesian networks in Python! What benefits does bnlearn offer over other bayesian analysis implementations?

* Build on top of the pgmpy library
* Contains the most-wanted bayesian pipelines
* Simple and intuitive
* Focus on structure learning, parameter learning and inference.

Sponsor
=======
**This library is created and maintained in my free time**. I like to work on my open-source libraries, and you can help by becoming a sponsor! The easiest way is by simply following me on medium, and it will cost you nothing! Simply go to my `medium profile <https://erdogant.medium.com/>`_ and press "follow". Read more on my `sponsor github page <https://github.com/sponsors/erdogant/>`_ why this is important. This also gives you various other ways to sponsor me!


Star is important too!
